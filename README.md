## Features

* Authentication: Implemented secure authentication mechanisms to protect the API.
* CRUD Operations: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for API resources.
* Schema Validation: Utilized schema validation to ensure data integrity and consistency.
* API Documentation: Created comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger.

## SQL Integration

* SQL Generated database schemas and wrote SQL queries.
* ORM Integration Integrated SQL databases into the API using ORMs for efficient data access.

## Database Migration

* Utilized database migration tools like Alembic to make incremental changes to the database schema and track changes effectively.

## Testing and Automation

* Implemented automated integration tests to verify code changes and ensure existing functionality remains intact. Used tools like Postman for API testing.
